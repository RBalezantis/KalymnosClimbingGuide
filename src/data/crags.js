        description: "The area known as 'Sectors' covers a broad range of sub-sectors above Masouri. It is an extremely popular and easily accessible area with a wide array of routes and grades. The climbing styles vary across the different sub-sectors, from technical vertical faces to steep, pocketed walls and tufas. With a large number of routes and a grade range from 5.10a to 5.12d, it's an ideal spot for a first-time visitor. Due to its size and orientation, sun and shade conditions vary, but it's generally a good choice for all-day climbing, allowing you to move between different walls as the sun moves.",
